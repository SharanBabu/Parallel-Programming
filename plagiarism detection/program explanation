AIM:
	to find similarity between two text documents and determine if it is plagiarised. (Based on a paper attatched with this folder)
	using Smith-Waterman Algorithm.

The logic of the code:
	Each sentence of the first file (src) is hashed and is compared with the hashed values of the sentences of the second file (des).
	
Here :
	(i) Hash comparison is sufficient because the hash function is so unique that the probability of 2 words with same hash value is very low.
	(ii) Each sentence should compulsorily end with "lastword[space]." and not "lastword."
	(iii) The code is done for a paragraph and can be exteded to a text.
